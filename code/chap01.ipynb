    "[The National Survey of Family Growth](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nsfg/about_nsfg.htm) (NSFG) is a survey conducted in the US by the CDC since 1973, in order to collect data about health, families etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "About the design of the study: \n",
    "- <b>Cross-sectional</b>: Captures a snapshot of a group at a point in time (As opposed to a <b>longitudinal</b> study which observes a group repeatedly over a period of time).\n",
    "- <b>Conducted in cycles</b>: The survey has been conducted several times, each of them referred to as <b>cycle</b>. In this book we'll use data from cycle 6.\n",
    "- <b>Data was collected from a subset of the population</b>: From the sample data, we aim to draw conclusions about the entire US population. The people who participate in a survey are called <b>respondents</b>.\n",
    "- <b>Oversampled</b>: In general, cross-sectional studies are meant to be <b>representative</b>, which means that every member of the target population has an equal chance of participating. The NSFG is not representative. Instead it is deliberately <b>oversampled</b>, which means the designers of the samples recruited three groups at higher rates than their representation in the US population. These three groups are Hispanic, African Americans and teenagers. The reason was to make sure that the number of respondents in each of these groups is large enough to draw valid statistical inference.\n",
    "- <b>Codebook</b>: When working with this kind of data, it is important to be familiar with the [codebook](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nsfg/nsfg_cycle6.htm) which documents the design of the study, the survey questions, etc."
